# Study-Efficiency-Analysis-Program
The goal of this project is to determine whether a student is using their study time efficiently by analyzing data such as hours studied, academic marks, and the study methods they use. The program then calculates a study efficiency score + provides targeted recommendations to help improve efficiency by suggesting more effective study methods.

# What the Project Does

This is an easy-to-use program that any user can navigate to improve their subject study efficiency. After registration/log in, the user enters data to be analyzed. The program uses a variety of calculations and methods to calculate efficiency, which is then revealed to the user. Additionally, it also provided unique recommendations to each user using the collected information. Finally, the user can choose to analyze another profile/subject or exit the program to view the leaderboard.

# Project Goals / Purpose
The purpose of this game is to provide a useful and easy-to-use study efficiency calculation application for the user. The users can move at their own pace, use their data and then let the program do the work of calculating efficiency and providing unique study recommendations. As for my goals, I wanted to work on a project I found interesting while practicing Java GUI programming, math in Java, inheritance, and file handling.

# Team Members
This project will be completed individually by Jershika, a student in class ICS4UR (2526-Sem1).
